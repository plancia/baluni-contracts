# Baluni V1 Protocol

## Overview

Baluni V1 is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that offers advanced financial tools and strategies such as dollar-cost averaging (DCA), yield optimization via Yearn Finance, and automated asset rebalancing. The protocol is designed to be modular, scalable, and easily extensible.

## Key Components

### Agents and Factories

- **BaluniV1Agent.sol**: This contract acts as an orchestrator, managing user interactions and executing rebalance operations when accessed via CLI.
- **BaluniV1AgentFactory.sol**: Responsible for creating and deploying new agent instances, facilitating modularity and scalability when accessed via CLI.

### Pools

- **BaluniV1Pool.sol**: These contracts represent standalone products within the protocol, handling specific financial operations independently.
- **BaluniV1PoolPeriphery.sol**: Provides auxiliary functions and extended features for the main pool contracts.

### Vaults

- **BaluniV1DCAVault.sol**: Implements dollar-cost averaging investment strategies, allowing users to invest steadily over time.
- **BaluniV1YearnVault.sol**: Integrates with Yearn Finance to optimize yield farming and maximize returns on deposited assets.

### Registries and Oracle

- **BaluniV1Registry.sol**: Maintains a comprehensive registry of various entities within the protocol.
- **BaluniV1PoolRegistry.sol**: Keeps records of all pools in the protocol.
- **BaluniV1Oracle.sol**: Provides essential data inputs like price feeds for the protocolâ€™s operations.

### Managers

- **BaluniV1Rebalancer.sol**: Manages the rebalancing of assets to maintain desired allocation ratios within the protocol.
- **BaluniV1Swapper.sol**: Facilitates asset swaps within the protocol, ensuring efficient and cost-effective trades.

### Fee Collection

- **BaluniV1Router.sol**: Collects fees generated from the operations of pools, Yearn Vaults, and DCA Vaults, centralizing the fee management within the protocol.

### Mock Contracts

- **MockOracle.sol**, **MockRebalancer.sol**, **MockSwapRouter.sol**, **MockToken.sol**: These contracts are used for testing and simulation purposes to ensure the robustness and reliability of the protocol.

## How It Works

1. **User Interaction**:
   - **CLI**: When accessed via the CLI, users interact with the protocol through agents, which manage their operations and execute their commands.
   - **UI**: When accessed via the UI, users interact with the protocol directly using their addresses.
2. **Standalone Financial Products**:
   - **Pools, Yearn Vaults, and DCA Vaults**: These components operate independently, each managing specific financial strategies and operations.
3. **Fee Management**: Fees generated from pools, Yearn Vaults, and DCA Vaults are sent to the `BaluniV1Router` contract, centralizing fee collection and distribution.
4. **Automated Strategies**: Features like dollar-cost averaging and asset rebalancing are automated to provide users with optimized financial outcomes.
5. **Data Integrity**: The protocol relies on oracle contracts to fetch accurate price feeds and other necessary data inputs.
6. **Vault Management**: All users are free to trigger compound, rebalance, and execute DCA operations within the vaults. There is no centralized manager for these actions.
